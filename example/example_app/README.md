Noodling around with idea of creating a simple component/widget that provides a test and development harness for general
Dart components.

Will add:
- Todo List - first with code, then support Github lookup (look to use Max's GridHub project)
- Automatic binding/manipulation system for properties
- Simple tabbed browser for various examples
